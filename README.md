#Project for organising some Hobbies

So I came upon this idea to give yourself some pocket money for doing hobby stuff like finishing a book or a game etc.

And since I'm prone to buy a lot of books, games, have a lot of new WIPs in art projects and never finish it, I thought that might be a good idea to organize myself.

This projects is currently for one User (since I'm honestly too lazy to organize everything with User-IDs right now and it's not intended to be this platform for anyone.) and is just something for myself to repeat learned stuff and maybe in the future add more new stuff I learn.
